After installing the software we need to update the mime database and the desktop
entry database so that the MIME type registry and the MIME/Application association
is all indexed.

These are the commands that have to be executed on post install and post uninstall:

update-mime-database $(datadir)/mime
update-desktop-database $(datadir)/applications

Note that $(datadir) usually is /usr/share.
