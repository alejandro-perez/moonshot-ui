msvc-example: demonstrates using libmoonshot-0.dll from Visual C

You must edit the Makefile to set up the correct paths before this
example will build.

To run it, you must set the correct PATH for the required DLL's:
libmoonshot-0.dll (which is in ../../libmoonshot/.libs/) and msrpc-mingw.dll
(which is in [msrpc-mingw tree]/build/). You will need to execute something
like the following:

    (in sh.exe:)

PATH=../../libmoonshot/.libs:/c/build/src/msrpc-mingw/build/:$PATH msvc-example

    (or in cmd.exe:)

PATH=..\..\libmoonshot\.libs;c:\build\src\msrpc-mingw\build\;%PATH% msvc-example
